**Problem**

Basically our idea is to getrid over of traditional way to track the patient data.
Every time patient go to new hospital, doctors are not able to know the previous treatments or disease or allergies to any medicine.
Also we want to improve medical decision made by doctor using Machine Learning.

**Solution**

In which we will have centralized (which can be made decentrelized in future for security and other purposes) which will have details of every patient with their basic details and every treatment related to that patient.

Now patient will carry only one QR code instaed of files for diffrent physical files.

**Other Features**

1) We are identifying the patient if he/she is retinopathy diabetic or not using Convolution Neural network.
2) Also we have feature to predict the disease by using symptoms using diffrent ML algorithms.
